# \# Binance Futures Data Fetcher

# 

# This is a simple Jupyter Notebook script to download historical kline data from the Binance Futures API.

# 

# Its main purpose is to download all available data for a specific symbol and check for any missing candles to ensure you have a complete dataset for analysis.

# 

# \## What it Does

# 

# \* Fetches data in batches (1500 records at a time) to get the full history.

# \* Cleans the data and formats it into a Pandas DataFrame.

# \* Checks the data against a full list of expected timestamps (based on your start date and interval).

# \* Reports any missing timestamps and tells you the "completeness" percentage.

# \* Saves the clean data to a main CSV file.

# \* Saves a list of the missing timestamps to a separate CSV file.

# 

# \## How to Use

# 

# 1\.  Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter or VS Code.

# 2\.  Add your own `api\_key` and `api\_secret` at the top of the file.

# 3\.  Change the `symbol`, `start\_date`, and `interval` parameters to match what you need.

# 4\.  Run all the cells.

# 5\.  Check the folder for your new CSV files.

# 

# \## Requirements

# 

# You need Python and these two libraries:

# 

# \* `pandas`

# \* `python-binance-futures-connector`

# 

# You can install them with:

# `pip install pandas python-binance-futures-connector`
